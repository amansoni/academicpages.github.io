excerpt: 'A connection has recently been drawn between dynamic optimization and reinforcement learning problems as subsets of a broader class of sequential decision-making problems. We present a unified approach that enables the cross-pollination of ideas between established communities, and could help to develop rigorous methods for algorithm comparison and selection for real-world resource-constrained problems.'

A connection has recently been drawn between dynamic optimization and reinforcement learning problems as subsets of a broader class of sequential decision-making problems. We present a unified approach that enables the cross-pollination of ideas between established communities, and could help to develop rigorous methods for algorithm comparison and selection for real-world resource-constrained problems.
